## Environment

* I‚Äôm not a morning person and prefer to have meetings in the afternoon my time so I can use the morning for focused work. I prefer not to have meetings past 6 or 6.30pm my time so I can use the evening hours for personal time or more focused work. I usually block out my Mondays and Fridays for focused working time but am happy to schedule meetings during those days if required
* I enjoy a healthy mix of collaboration and solo work


## Communication

* Slack and E-Mail work equally well for communication with me, however I do not keep my work Slack or work E-Mail on my phone. I do this intentionally so I can truly sign off from work
* I‚Äôm an inbox zero person and will check my E-Mails as well as Slack messages several times a day
* I prefer meetings (ideally with a clear agenda) to long Slack exchanges, however too many meetings really drain my energy levels as I‚Äôm more of an introvert who has taught themselves to be social over the years üòÉ It‚Äôs all about balance!


## Feedback

* I like to receive feedback rapidly, ideally right after the fact. I ask that the feedback be actionable so I can improve things accordingly
* I‚Äôd prefer if people come to me directly, by scheduling a meeting or messaging me on Slack (Zoom is preferred if it‚Äôs a bigger conversation), rather than involving my manager, however I understand that in some situations it may be more comfortable to pass on the feedback to the manager first, who can then pass it on to me
* I usually need a bit of time to process feedback, especially if it's of critical nature, before I am ready to talk about it


## Support

* In general I‚Äôm pretty good at asking for help if I need any and am equally happy to help others 
* I have experience in OSS communities (especially the Python community), meetups, conferences (organisation & speaking), diversity & inclusion work (including Code of Conducts), non-profits, and mentorship
* I‚Äôm always happy to chat about mental health as well as I do have a lot of personal experience with the topic
* I can be a bit of a black and white person and quick at saying ‚Äúno‚Äù at times so please feel free to challenge me in situations like this. I enjoy that as it gives me an opportunity to reconsider things and properly think them through 


## Favorites

* Favorite quote: ‚ÄúBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.‚Äù
* Love American country music and 90s pop (Spice Girls and Backstreet Boys for life!)
* I enjoy going to concerts, musicals, the theatre, and cinema
* My guilty pleasure is trashy reality tv shows (everything from 90 Day Fianc√© to the Real Housewives series is right up my alley)
